## Asking Business Questions

NEXUS understands natural language queries about your data. Here are some examples of effective questions:

### Sales Analysis
- "What were our highest sales months last year?"
- "How did Product A perform compared to Product B in Q3?"
- "Show me sales by region for the past 5 quarters"

### Performance Metrics
- "What is our customer acquisition cost by channel?"
- "Which products have the highest profit margin?"
- "How has our market share changed over the past year?"

### Predictive Queries
- "Predict our sales for the next quarter based on historical data"
- "What's the forecast for customer growth over the next 6 months?"
- "If current trends continue, which product category will be our top performer next year?"

### Visualization Requests
- "Create a bar chart comparing revenue by department"
- "Show me a line graph of monthly active users"
- "Generate a pie chart of market share by competitor"

## Choosing the Right Model

NEXUS offers multiple AI models:

- **OpenAI**: Best for complex business analysis and nuanced insights
- **Gemini**: Fastest response times, excellent for data processing
- **Mistral/LLaMA**: Privacy-focused options for sensitive data (available in Enterprise version)

Select the appropriate model based on your needs using the radio buttons in the interface.

## Output Types

NEXUS can generate three types of outputs:

### Analysis
Detailed textual analysis of your data based on your query. This includes insights, patterns, and business implications.

### Visualization
Interactive charts and graphs that visually represent your data. You can download these visualizations for use in presentations or reports.

### Prediction
Forward-looking analysis based on historical patterns in your data. Includes confidence levels and influencing factors.

## Tips for Getting the Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "What was our revenue in Q2 2023?" will get better results than "How are sales doing?"

2. **Provide context**: Mention time periods, product categories, or regions when relevant

3. **Start simple**: Begin with straightforward queries to understand your data before asking complex questions

4. **Experiment with models**: Try different AI models to see which works best for your specific data and queries

5. **Use visualization**: For data patterns and comparisons, visualization often provides clearer insights than text

## Saving and Sharing Results

All visualizations can be downloaded as PNG files using the "Download Visualization" button. Text analyses can be copied directly from the interface.

For Enterprise users, NEXUS also supports:
- Scheduled reports
